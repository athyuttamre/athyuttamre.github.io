    <p class="byline">Software Engineering and Design Intern &middot; Summer 2016</p>

    <p class="content intro-text">
      I spent the summer of 2016 as a software engineering and design intern at Figma.
      I mainly worked on two projects: designing, building, and shipping the project
      activity feed, and researching a techincal spec for a future plugin API. Along
      the way, I also rearchitected our CSS workflow, introducing CSS Modules to the
      codebase.

        <h1>Project Activity Feed</h1>
        <p>
          Figma is an online, collaborative design tool. A core part of the collaborative
          experience is the shared filesystem where projects and files are stored,
          and users work together.
        </p>

        <p>
          When multiple designers are working on a project together, all kinds of
          activity takes place. Designers can create and edit files, leave comments,
          update the project settings, change sharing preferences, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the months leading up to launch, we wanted to make sure that working
          together on a  project wasn’t a chaotic experience, and creating the
          project activity feed was the first step in that process.

        <h2>Problem</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            When designers, engineers, and PMs on a team work together, how do we
            give them a sense of what’s going on?
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Still in limited preview, Figma was fast becoming the go-to tool for our
          users. However, wtih Multiplayer about to launch, we had a renewed focus
          on improving the collaborative user experience. Through talking to our
          current users, we realized two things:
        </p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Figma is used not just by designers, but often by engineers, and PMs too.</li>
            <li>
              When teams adopt Figma, they often want to know what’s been happening at the
              team, project, and indivual user level.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal was to explore ways to solve this problem, and then go out and build it.

        <h2>Process</h2>

        <h3>01. Audit and Research</h3>

        <p>
          Before diving into problem, I took a couple of days to survey other products
          and put together an audit of activity feeds. Here’s a few of them.

        <h3>02. Personas</h3>

        <p>
          Next, I sat down and identified a few different personas of our target
          users (individual contributors, engineers, PMs), and the kinds of scenarios
          they find themselves in.

        <h3>03. Problem Spec</h3>

        <p>
          This research helped me frame the problem better, and break it down into
          six constituent issues. For this first version, we decided to focus on
          two key issues: visibility and helping users view and debug history.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <p>
          In this way, starting with our users’ goals and investigating other products
          helped me frame the problem well. It also prepared me well for the next stage
          of the design process: ideation and exploration.
        </p>

        <h3 style="margin-top: 90px;">03. Ideation</h3>

        <p>
          The next step was going wide and being generative; coming up with a whole
          bunch of ways to surface activity. I explored ways to do so at the global,
          team, project, and user level. I also took a look at different kinds of
          “stories” that we could show users.

        <h3>04. High-fidelity Explorations</h3>

        <p>
          Having explored many directions, I then converged into a few good options,
          and drew them out in high-fidelity. At a high level, we were exploring
          two ideas: a visual, card-based activity feed, versus a sidebar based
          historical log.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

        <h3>05. Solution</h3>

        <p>
          In the end, we decided to build a simple version of the sidebar for our
          initial release. It fit into the existing interface design, and offered
          the core feature of the activity feed: the historical log and a way to
          debug missing files.
        </p>

        <p>
          The design phase allowed us to explore a wide variety of ideas, and I’m
          sure some will manifest themselves in other ways in the future. Concepts
          like presences—showing who’s online—as well as the ability to manage comments
          in one place will be key in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having decided on a first version, I transitioned into the next phase: engineering.

        <h2>Engineering</h2>

        <p>
          After four weeks of design, I led the project’s engineering for the rest of my internship.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 style="color: #56CCF2;">01. Database and Logging</h3>
            <p>
              Working with Ruby and Postgres, I set the database schema, wrote migrations,
              and set up event logging at various points in our codebase.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 style="color: #27AE60;">02. Back-end API</h3>
            <p>
              Next, I created new API end-points, implemented pagination, and connected
              them to the front-end to post and get activity data.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 style="color: #F2C94C;">03. Collation Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            An important part of the engineering was to combine multiple similar
            events into compact stories. This collation had to maintain causal
            order (a file can’t be edited after it has been deleted), but it also
            had to avoid the noise of hundreds of similar events.
          </p>
          <p>
            To solve this issue, I came up with an online algorithm that responded
            to each incoming event in real-time. Through a series of heuristics,
            it would combine similar events together across time, action type, user,
            and file.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 style="color: #EB5757;">04. Front-end UI</h3>
            <p>
              Next, I implemented the UI on the front-end using TypeScript, React,
              Redux, and CSS Modules, along with infinite scrolling for the feed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 style="color: #9B51E0;">05. Polish and shipping</h3>
            <p>
              Finally, after much polish and a couple weeks on staging, we shipped
              the activity feed to all users with Figma’s public launch!
