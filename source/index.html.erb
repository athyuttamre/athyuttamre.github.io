<p>My name is Atty, and I'm an undergraduate student in computer science and design at Brown University. As a programmer, I'm interested in computer graphics and human computer interaction, and as a designer in <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> design and illustration.</p>

<p>This summer I'm working as a design engineering intern at <a href="http://kayak.com">KAYAK</a>. During the school year, I'm also closely involved in putting together <a href="http://hackatbrown.org">Hack@Brown</a>.</p>
