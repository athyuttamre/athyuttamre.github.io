  <h1>Balance</h1>
  <p class="byline">Interaction Design &middot; Fall 2015</p>

  <p class="content intro-text">
    Balance is a money-tracking app for users with variable income. I designed and
    prototyped the idea for an Interaction Design studio last fall, and am hoping
    to build it one day for iOS using the <a href="http://plaid.com">Plaid</a> API.

        <blockquote>
          <p>How can we help students and folks with variable income keep track of their money?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Students, hourly workers, Uber drivers; regular money tracking apps
          don't work for them. Mint is too complicated, Level and so on make
          assumptions.

          I had spent hours on Reddit researching r/personalfinance. I'd tried
          budgeting, and so on, but really all I needed to know was how much money
          I had, and where it was going.

        <h2>Research</h2>

        <p>
          Talking to college students.

          Characteristically, they were folks with variable income, volatile spending,
          occasional planning. Some had regular jobs, some got boosts of money from
          parents a few times a year, and so on.

          - They wanted to know how much money they have, where it was going.
          - Trends to compare to past months, and knowing important things ahead
            of time. Had too much on plate already, no time to plan.
          - Occasional tips to help save more.
