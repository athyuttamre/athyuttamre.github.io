<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I'm a 20 year-old product designer and front-end engineer studying computer science at Brown University. Originally from Hyderabad, India, I moved to quaint Providence, RI for school two years ago.</p>

<p>I came to be a designer in a roundabout way.<p>

<p>As a child I loved assembling computers, and felt really proud when I made PowerPoint presentations for homework and presented them off my 4 MB floppy disk. In middle-school I started running blogs, but spent more time switching WordPress themes than actually writing. One thing led to another, and armed with a pirated copy of Photoshop, I started learning design.</p>

<p>At Brown, I've explored the interesection between technology and design in many ways — through computer graphics, human computer interaction, interaction design, human factors, and much more. I've also taken classes at the Rhode Island School of Design, and helped lead the fantastic team behind <a href="/hackatbrown.html">Hack@Brown</a>.</p>

<p>Working at <a href="/facebook.html">Facebook</a> and <a href="/kayak.html">KAYAK</a> has taught me an incredible amount, and I'm keen on tackling complex systems design challenges to find simple solutions. In so combining the algorithmic thinking of a programmer with the empathetic understanding of a designer, I hope to build useful and meaningful products.</p>

<p>If you'd like to take a look, here's my <a href="/files/Athyuttam%20Eleti.pdf">résumé</a>. I'd love to hear from you, so please do get in touch!</p>
