<h1>Atty Eleti</h1>

<p>Welcome to my website, one that is very much a work in progress.</p>

<p>My name is Atty, and I'm an undergrad at Brown studying computer science and design. My interests vary from usability and web standards to human computer interaction.</p>

<p>This summer I'm working as a product design intern at <a href="http://facebook.com/design">Facebook</a>. Previously, I was at <a href="http://kayak.com">KAYAK</a>. During the school year, I help lead the fantastic team behind <a href="http://hackatbrown.org">Hack@Brown</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get in touch, please send me a message on <a href="http://facebook.com/athyuttamre">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/athyuttamre">Twitter</a>. Alternatively, you can email me at <a href="mailto:athyuttamre@gmail.com">athyuttamre@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>Here's my <a href="{{ "/files/Athyuttam Eleti Resume.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">résumé</a>.</p>
