  <p class="byline">Interaction Design &middot; Fall 2015</p>

  <p class="content intro-text">
    Balance is a money-tracking app for users with variable income. I designed and
    prototyped the idea for an Interaction Design studio last fall, and am hoping
    to build it one day for iOS using the <a href="http://plaid.com">Plaid</a> API.

        <h2>Problem</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>How can we help students and people with variable income keep track of their money?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Students, hourly workers, Uber drivers—regular money tracking apps
          don't work for them. Apps like Mint are too complicated, and apps like
          Level make assumptions about a regular income. But these groups of people
          also need help keeping track of their money and planning their expenses.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a student, I'd spent hours on r/personalfinance and other websites
          learning about personal finance and bugdgeting. Most solutions were
          too complex though, and my bank's existing services were sub-par.
        </p>

        <p>
          I figured this must be a problem shared by other students and users with
          variable income, so I decided to try and design a solution.

          Variable Income &middot; Volatile Spending &middot; Occassional Planning
        </h3>

        <p>
          Talking to students around me made me realize the three characteristics
          of my target audience: that they had variable income (some had jobs, some
          had occassional transfers from parents); volatile spending (books at the
          beginning of the semester); and occasional planning (too busy to sit down
          and make a budget.)
        </p>

        <p>
          I sensed a need to have an <i>intelligent</i> money tracking app; something
          that would help you compare your spending to previous months, let you know
          of important things ahead of time, and occasionally give you tips to improve.
          This culminated in the design of Balance.

        <h3>Bank Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          Balance would integrate with over 6000 banks across the country, all through
          Plaid's Link API.
        </p>

        <h3>Calendar View</h3>
        <p>
          Calendar view helps users visualize their expenses over the last few days, helping
          build an intuition for how their money is flowing.
        </p>

        <h3>Venmo + Square Cash Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Often one person will pay for a dinner, and get reimbursed from friends
          over Venmo or Square Cash. Balance integrates with these apps to make those
          payments transparent.
