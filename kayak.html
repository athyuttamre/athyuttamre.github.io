  <h1>KAYAK</h1>
  <p class="byline">Front-end Engineering, Product Design &middot; Summer 2014</p>

  <p class="content intro-text">As a design engineering intern at KAYAK, I redesigned and built My Trips, a trip planning tool used by thousands of users. Working with both the UI engineering and design teams, I worked in HTML, CSS (with Less), JavaScript, Java, and Photoshop.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>My Trips is a travel planning tool that consolidates plans from multiple websites into one web itinerary. Users can simply forward their booking receipts to trips@kayak.com for them to be automatically added to their trip.</p>

      <p>While useful by itself on the web, a key part of the trip experience also included the mobile app. Travel alerts, calendar synchronization, and sharing features brought the entire flow together.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>

      <blockquote>
        <p>How do we reimagine and re-architect My Trips to improve the user experience?</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>My Trips was <a href="https://www.kayak.com/news/kayak-launches-free-itinerary-management-tool-kayak-trips/">originally launched</a> as KAYAK Trips in late 2009. Since then, despite incredible user loyalty, the feature had seen slow and scarce development.</p>

      <p>In addition, over 40,000 new users would visit the Trips page every day, but wouldn’t convert since the product didn’t pitch its value well enough.</p>

      <p>Finally, as the sole developer on the product, I inherited a poorly structured and messy codebase with a whole range of extra styles and scripts affecting load time and engineering complexity.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="content">
        <h2>Solutions &middot; <span>Design</span></h2>
        <p>I started by updating the Trips home page. Introducing a simplified navigation and new visual style helped me set the tone for the rest of the project.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="content">
          Next, in tackling the event details page, I worked on a bunch of little features that improved the user experience.

        <div class="col-md-7">

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-5">
          <ul id="design-items" class="side-items">
            <li>
              <h3>Simplified Navigation</h3>
              <p>By removing unnecessary scripts and simplifying our LESS and Velocity templates, I reduced loadtime and improved code maintainability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Action Bar</h3>
              <p>In addition to fixing some tricky asynchronous loading bugs, I added dynamic resizing functionality and some helper functions to the Maps library.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Notes and Calendar</h3>
              <p>Focusing on speed for the new Trips, I implemented pushState based navigation across all browsers.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        Finally, I also began work on a landing page for the Trips product. Although it didn't make it into production, it represented some early thoughts for a page that should've existed a long time ago.

        <p>Primarily writing front-end code, I built all the features I designed, and helped trim down the codebase multifold. Some of the key changes include:</p>

                <h3><code>pushState</code> based Navigation</h3>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>

      <p>I’m always extremely grateful to KAYAK for taking a bet with me. I’d just finished freshman year when I joined them, but was eager to learn more about front-end engineering and design to hit the ground running.</p>

        <p>The summer was also my first introduction to accessibility and web standards, topics I care deeply about to this day.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Some of the invaluable engineering skills I learned: working on a massive codebase, version control with Git at scale, building apps with the MVC framework, working with web standards and browser compatibility, and most importantly, what it’s like to work at a company. The summer was also my first introduction to accessibility and web standards, topics I care deeply about to this day.</p>

      <p>As a designer, it was the first time I was designing for others. All my projects in the past were personal projects, and working on Trips really got me thinking about product challenges from a user-centered perspective.</p>
