  <p class="content intro-text">
    For the last year, I've designed, built, and maintained <a href="https://signmeup.cs.brown.edu">SignMeUp</a>,
    a webapp that allows teaching assistants to hold office hours and students to sign up for them.
    In essence, it is an online queue, and is now used by over half a dozen courses at Brown.

      <p>
        Every semester, 10% of Brown's student body enrolls in a computer science class.
        As the fastest growing major on campus, the department has to find new ways to scale
        really great pedagogy to hundreds of students, many with no prior experience. The
        most effective such method has been our undergraduate teaching assistant program.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrt5wF4f70">TA program</a>
        at Brown has a long tradition in collaborative and intimate learning. Most
        courses have a student to TA ratio of 7:1, and many students feel a sense
        of giving-back when TAing classes they took and enjoyed. However, with some
        class sizes tipping over 400 students, this puts a large burden on TAs.
      </p>

      <p>
        SignMeUp steps in to solve one very specific problem. When tens of students
        are waiting to get help from TAs, how do we coordinate these long lines?
      </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>How can we help TAs coordinate long lines at office hours?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Holding office hours for a large class of 400 students poses many problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          For one, writing names on a whiteboard can only scale so long.
          In addition, students are forced to physically wait in the same room
          as office hours until their name is callled. Sometimes, students would
          line up before office hours even began, which isn't fair to students
          who show up on time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The existing solution was students writing their names on a whiteboard.
          In 2014, three students decided to create the first version of SignMeUp,
          but as beta software goes, it had a lot of room to improve. Since I
          took on the project, SMU has undergone two full redesigns, and over 13 releases.

      <p>
        Students hoping to sign up for hours can simply head to the website on
        their laptop or phone. Authentication is handled with Brown's Shibboleth
        user system, meaning students don't have to create a new account or
        remember a new password.

      <p>
        Groups of students can sign up together too, and can ask to be notified
        just before their turn by email or text.

      <p>

        to receive help.

        <img src="/img/signmeup/multiple-queues.png">

        <p>
          Teaching assistants have a slightly different interface for queues.
          They can create multiple queues for different purposes, manage the
          queue, and go through the student tickets.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <img src="/img/signmeup/queue-status.png" style="height: 132px; margin: 0;">
            <h3>Queue Status</h3>
            <p>
              A queue can be active, cutoff, or ended. A cutoff queue accepts
              signups, but it's a sign to students that they may not be helped
              before hours end.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <figure style="height: 132px; background-color: white; display: flex; align-items: center;">
              <img src="/img/signmeup/restricted-sessions.png">
            </figure>
            <h3>Restricted Sessions</h3>
            <p>
              Restricted sessions limit signups to a specific computer, ensuring
              students are physically in the same space as hours, and helping
              students without computers.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Ticket Management</h3>

        <img src="/img/signmeup/ticket-management.png">

        <p>
          Finally, TAs can manage student tickets. Tickets are first "claimed", at
          which point a timer starts ticking showing the TA how long they've been
          helping the student. Once done, they can mark the ticket as done.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the student is missing, however, the TA can send out an email or
          text notification first. If the student doesn't show up, they can also mark
          the student as missing.

      <img class="shadow-img" src="/img/signmeup/settings.png">

      <p>
        Head TAs handle course logistics and policies. The settings page
        helps them edit course details and settings.
      </p>

      <p>
        One such settings is the <strong>Signup Gap</strong>. This is the minimum
        amount of time a student must wait between tickets, ensuring that a student
        can only sign up, say, once an hour. Busy hours remain fair to all students
        this way.
      </p>

      <img class="shadow-img" src="/img/signmeup/htas.png">

      <p>
        HTAs can also control the roles and permissions for their staff. A course
        can have multiple HTAs and TAs. In addition, Meta TAs (or MTAs) run the
        entire TA program at Brown, and they have admin-level access.

      <p>
        Working on SignMeUp has been extremely rewarding. Walking through our
        computer science building and seeing freshmen use software I built is a
        great feeling. In addition, recurring positive feedback from TAs is
        extremely encouraging.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        <p>
          [SignMeUp] has become an invaluable part of our process and helps coordinate
          students among several TAs at a time for dozens of hours a week.

      <p>
        Over the next two semesters, I hope to continue adding features, improving
        the analytics dashboard, and making SignMeUp more mobile friendly. Hopefully
        SMU remains useful to courses for years to come!
